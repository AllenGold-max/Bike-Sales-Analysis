## Project Insights

- Relationship between income and bike purchases
- Bike purchases across different age groups
- Influence of commute distance on bike purchases
- Insights from marital status, education, region, and commute distance filters

## Final Conclusion

The "Bike Sales Dashboard" reveals that higher-income individuals, particularly males, are more likely to buy bikes. Middle-aged customers dominate bike purchases, with lower rates among adolescents and seniors. Shorter commutes drive higher bike purchases, declining as distances grow. Filters for education, marital status, and region provide additional analysis insights.
